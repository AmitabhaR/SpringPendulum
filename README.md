# Spring Pendulum Simulation
Welcome to Spring Pendulum project. This objective of this project is to carry out a simple computational analysis of the motion of a spring pendulum. The simulation has been programmed in Java programming language. 

The src folder contains the source code for the simulation process. 

The simulation uses the Euler Method of solving differential equations numerically when a set of initial conditions of the system is provided. The physical system is described by a pair of coupled non-linear differential equations. They are solved iteratively using Euler method, and later the results are visualsed using MatLab Plotter. Please check the SpringPendulumArticle for the results obtained in some specified cases.
